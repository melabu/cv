  "aboutMe": "Hello world! I am a skilled web developer with over 2 years of hands-on experience, specialized in creating user-centric web solutions that prioritize the UX and accessibility. My journey began at a regional bank, where I collaborated with different stakeholders as a business process analyst. This experience ignited my love for programming and I had the opportunity to enroll in a coding bootcamp. There, I mastered programming fundamentals, adopted a team-oriented approach, and became more proficient with the basic tools for my daily tasks. Since then, I've been working as a web app developer, consistently pushing boundaries in the digital realm. Recently, I relocated to the Netherlands, eager to embrace new challenges. I invite you to review my resume and connect with me to explore how I can contribute to your team.",
