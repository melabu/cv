  Hi! I'm Ana. Life has changed paths for me recently and I am therefore currently working towards becoming a Web Designer with a strong focus on User Experience. I have a great eye for aesthetics and I love visual simplicity as well.
  I am very interested in taking my first steps as a web designer in a team with a strong focus on UI/UX. 

  Based on my work experience, I am customer focussed, I am a strong communicator and have excellent writing skills.
  I am constantly looking up to improve myself as a professional and thus as a human being. Please take a look at my portfolio whenever you have the chance!
